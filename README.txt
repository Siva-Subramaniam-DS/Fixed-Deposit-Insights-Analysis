Here’s an overview of **AI**, **ML**, and **DL**:

---

### **1. Artificial Intelligence (AI):**
- **Definition:** AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence by machines. It encompasses any system or application that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence, such as reasoning, problem-solving, decision-making, and language understanding.
- **Key Features:**  
  - Perception (e.g., recognizing images, sounds, or objects).  
  - Reasoning and learning from data or past experiences.  
  - Decision-making and problem-solving.  
  - Natural language understanding and generation (e.g., chatbots, translation).  
- **Examples:**  
  - Virtual assistants (e.g., Alexa, Siri).  
  - Autonomous vehicles.  
  - Recommendation systems (e.g., Netflix, Spotify).

---

### **2. Machine Learning (ML):**
- **Definition:** ML is a subset of AI that focuses on building systems that can learn and improve from data without being explicitly programmed. It involves designing algorithms that analyze data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions based on those patterns.
- **Key Techniques:**  
  - **Supervised Learning:** Models learn from labeled data (e.g., predicting house prices based on historical data).  
  - **Unsupervised Learning:** Models find hidden patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., clustering similar customers).  
  - **Reinforcement Learning:** Models learn optimal behaviors by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards/punishments.  
- **Examples:**  
  - Spam email detection.  
  - Fraud detection in financial transactions.  
  - Predictive maintenance in manufacturing.

### **3. Deep Learning (DL):**
- **Definition:** DL is a subset of ML that uses artificial neural networks (inspired by the human brain) to process data. It excels at handling large-scale data and complex tasks that involve high-dimensional inputs like images, text, or speech.
- **Key Features:**  
  - Utilizes layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) in neural networks.  
  - Requires large amounts of data and computational power.  
  - Excels in feature extraction and representation learning automatically.  
- **Examples:**  
  - Image recognition (e.g., identifying objects in photos).  
  - Natural language processing (e.g., language translation, sentiment analysis).  
  - Autonomous driving (e.g., detecting pedestrians, lane boundaries).

### **Hierarchy Relationship:**
**AI** ⟶ encompasses **ML** ⟶ encompasses **DL**

In short:
- **AI** is the broader concept of machines being "intelligent."
- **ML** is a way to achieve AI by allowing machines to learn from data.
- **DL** is an advanced form of ML, specialized in handling very large and complex datasets.

## Fixed Deposit Insights & Analysis App

### Overview
This application, built using **Streamlit**, provides insights, visualizations, and sentiment analysis of fixed deposit data for **General Citizens** and **Senior Citizens**. It integrates the **Ollama LLM** to allow users to interactively query the data for more insights.

---

### Code Breakdown

#### 1. **Dependencies and Initialization**
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import streamlit as st
import time
from langchain_ollama import OllamaLLM
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
import httpcore
```
- **Purpose**: Import necessary libraries for data processing, visualization, and creating a user interface.
- **Pros**: Modular libraries enable powerful data manipulation and an interactive UI.
- **Cons**: Dependencies like `OllamaLLM` require a specific setup, which may not work out of the box.

#### 2. **LLM Initialization**
```python
try:
    model = OllamaLLM(model="llava")
except Exception as e:
    st.error("Failed to initialize OllamaLLM. Ensure the server is running. Error: " + str(e))
    model = None
```
- **Purpose**: Initialize the **Ollama LLM** to provide chatbot functionality.
- **Steps**:
  1. Try to load the LLM model `llava`.
  2. Display an error message if the server is not running.
- **Pros**: Adds dynamic query capability for insights.
- **Cons**: Dependency on an external server; failure makes this feature inaccessible.

#### 3. **LLM Query Handler**
```python
template = """
Answer the question below.

Here is the conversation history:
{context}

Question: {question}

Answer:
"""
```
- **Purpose**: Define a prompt template for interacting with the LLM.
- **Steps**:
  1. Collect user questions and conversation history.
  2. Use the template to generate model responses.
- **Pros**: Keeps user interactions structured.
- **Cons**: Template context might not adapt well to specific user inputs.

### File Upload and Preprocessing

#### 4. **Upload and Validate CSV**
```python
uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload a CSV file with fixed deposit data", type="csv")
```
- **Purpose**: Allow users to upload fixed deposit data in CSV format.
- **Steps**:
  1. Check if the file has the required columns.
  2. Process valid files; show an error otherwise.
- **Pros**: Streamlined input for users.
- **Cons**: Strict column requirements might restrict flexibility.

### Data Processing Functions

#### 5. **Filter by Citizen Type**
```python
def filter_by_citizen_type(df, citizen_type):
    if citizen_type == "General Citizen":
        return df[(df['Age'] >= 18) & (df['Age'] <= 54)]
    elif citizen_type == "Senior Citizen":
        return df[df['Age'] >= 55]
```
